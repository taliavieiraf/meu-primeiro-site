              But nothing is as yours as I am, nor the night as yours as I am, for in the darkness I am your beacon to light the darkness. Nothing is as mine as you, because not even the brightness of the stars is as intense as your smile. Nothing is as wonderful as what I feel for you, because since creation, in the womb I already loved you even before I met you, because we were already predestined. Nothing is as strong as what I feel for you, because it is with love that I will live loving you. And nothing is more important than you in my life, because I could call you my OÂ², or my wake up, or my good morning or my "Thank you Lord" at all times, but I call you my love because I just need to of you and for you I am in love. I love you!
